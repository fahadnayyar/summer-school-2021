When designing your Sharded Hash Table, you will need to define a separate module for each of the Environment, Network and Distributed System. You can draw "inspiration" from previous exercises as to how those should look like.

You need an application specification, an interpretation function I() from
the distributed system state, and a lemma showing that
DistributedSystem.Next(s, s') implies Application.Next(I(s), I(s')).

If you are still struggling, hint02 contains the full description for the
DistributedSystem modules.

hint03 gives away the complete Application Specification state machine.
