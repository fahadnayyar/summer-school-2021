Define an InFlight predicate for messages that uses epoch numbers in
messages and at clients.

Invariant conjuncts:
  - toss in WFState, because it'll let other predicates dereference s.hosts[i]
    without hassle

  - Safety

  - If there's a message in flight, it's the only one. (equivalently,
    if there are two messages in flight, they're equal.)

  - A message in flight means no client thinks it holds the lock,
    and conversely.

  - If a message is in flight, its epoch number exceeds that of all clients

  - If a client holds the lock, its epoch number exceeds that of all other
  clients.
