  - warn that there's nothing to check in Dafny.
ex12. more algebraic datatypes

*** Here: introduce "soundness" and "completeness".
* Dafny is "sound" (haha), so it will never tell you something is correct if it's not.
* But it's not "complete": it may not be able to see a true statement, and will thus
*   give a "false" error. That's necessary, because we're reasoning in an
*   undecidable domain.
*   (For example, if we assert the Reimann hypothesis, we can't expect Dafny to answer
*   authoritatively.)
ex13. quantifiers
ex14. set comprehensions, maps  BROKEN: look up map literal syntax
ex15. Comprehensions, the finite heuristic, axioms, recursion
    (have to uncomment to find the work)
ex16. Hoare logic

ex18 Recursion challenge
