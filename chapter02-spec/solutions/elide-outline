Chapter 2 demo plan.

1. Display exercise01 on screen.

1.1. Discuss IsPrime spec.

1.2. Discuss Main.
  - You can run it, if you want! dafny_exe. It's not interesting.

1.3. Ask people to begin writing test_prime in exercise01.dfy.
  a. You want to iterate through possible factors f .. i-1. Build a for
     loop using while.
  b. Inside the loop, if divides(i,f), bail out with false.
  c. If you survive the loop, return true!
  d. You'll need a loop invariant to accumulate knowledge through the
    loop and carry it to the final return.
  e. Use assert statements to understand what dafny is missing. You'll
    need to leave one lying around, for reasons we'll discuss.


2.1. Discuss spec. Write IsSorted.

2.2. Hand out exercise02.dfy, which leaves the bodies empty.
  Spend time developing the examples until they pass the spec.

2.3. Deploy the trap. Write fast_sort in one line.

2.4. Discuss a *better* spec, adding the multiset-equivalence conjunct.

2.5. Spend time working through how to find the proof of multiset
  maintenance.
