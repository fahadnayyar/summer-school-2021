 // case analysis step 1: dst changed. Was it between start,end,
        // equal to start or end, or on the opposide side (end,start)?
        // answer -> only dst==end matters.


          // case analysis step 2:
          // did dst take on k.ids[src], v.highest_heard[src], or
          // v.highest_heard[dst]?
              // src now included in extended chord.
              // Covered by prior-state chord.
            ...becmose a Between argument that reveals UniqueIDs problem.

            // dst got src's id, and that was *higher* than src's highest
            // heard,
            // which means that this chord must have started at src.
