Here's a reasonable state machine type definition. The server knows the lock is
unlocked, or knows which client has it. Each client either thinks they have or
haven't acquired the lock.

datatype ServerGrant = Unlocked | Client(id: nat)
datatype ClientRecord = Released | Acquired
datatype Variables = Variables(server: ServerGrant, clients: seq<ClientRecord>)
